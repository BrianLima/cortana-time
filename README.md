cortana-time
============

So I spent a day writting this small extension for Windows Phone's Cortana - something like time teller - and I wanted to submit the app to Windows Phone Store. Nope! I have to submit screenshots in WXGA resolution. However my device has 800x480 res. "Use the emulator" I thought. Nope again! I cannot use the emulator due to lack of RAM on my PC. And as I created the app in VS 2013 on Windows 8.1, I have to use this version to even open a project. Moreover - my second PC has W8 on board, so I can't even open project there.
